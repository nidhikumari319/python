    "Mutable Objects: These are objects whose value can be changed after they are created.\n",

    "Examples : lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n",

    "Mutable: Yes, you can change what’s inside. For example, you can add or remove items.\n",

    "Immutable: No, you can’t change what’s inside. If you want to make a change, you have to create a new one.\n",

    "Does It Stay the Same?\n",

    "\n",
    "else Statement: Executes code if none of the preceding conditions are true.\n",

    "Nested Conditions: it handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on the outcome of logical expressions.\n",
